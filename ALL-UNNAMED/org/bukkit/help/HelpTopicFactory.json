You can use a custom HelpTopic to change the way all the commands in your plugin display in the help. If your plugin implements a complex permissions system, a custom help topic may also be appropriate. \n\u003cp\u003e To automatically bind your plugin\u0027s commands to your custom HelpTopic implementation, first make sure all your commands or executors derive from a custom base class (it doesn\u0027t have to do anything). Next implement a custom HelpTopicFactory that accepts your custom command base class and instantiates an instance of your custom HelpTopic from it. Finally, register your HelpTopicFactory against your command base class using the \u003ca href\u003d\"HelpMap.html#registerHelpTopicFactory(java.lang.Class,org.bukkit.help.HelpTopicFactory)\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eHelpMap.registerHelpTopicFactory(Class, HelpTopicFactory)\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e method. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e As the help system iterates over all registered commands to make help topics, it first checks to see if there is a HelpTopicFactory registered for the command\u0027s base class. If so, the factory is used to make a help topic rather than a generic help topic. If no factory is found for the command\u0027s base class and the command derives from \u003ca href\u003d\"../command/PluginCommand.html\" title\u003d\"class in org.bukkit.command\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003ePluginCommand\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, then the type of the command\u0027s executor is inspected looking for a registered HelpTopicFactory. Finally, if no factory is found, a generic help topic is created for the command.\u003c/p\u003e",
