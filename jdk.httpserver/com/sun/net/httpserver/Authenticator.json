The implementation must return a Authenticator.Failure, Authenticator.Success or Authenticator.Retry object as appropriate: Failure means the authentication has completed, but has failed due to invalid credentials. Success means that the authentication has succeeded, and a Principal object representing the user can be retrieved by calling Authenticator.Success.getPrincipal(). Retry means that another HTTP exchange is required. Any response headers needing to be sent back to the client are set in the given HttpExchange. The response code to be returned must be provided in the Retry object. Retry may occur multiple times.",
