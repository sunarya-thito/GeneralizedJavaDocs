      "comment": "Resolves parsed ChronoField values into a date during parsing. Most TemporalField implementations are resolved using the resolve method on the field. By contrast, the ChronoField class defines fields that only have meaning relative to the chronology. As such, ChronoField date fields are resolved here in the context of a specific chronology. ChronoField instances are resolved by this method, which may be overridden in subclasses. EPOCH_DAY - If present, this is converted to a date and all other date fields are then cross-checked against the date. PROLEPTIC_MONTH - If present, then it is split into the YEAR and MONTH_OF_YEAR. If the mode is strict or smart then the field is validated. YEAR_OF_ERA and ERA - If both are present, then they are combined to form a YEAR. In lenient mode, the YEAR_OF_ERA range is not validated, in smart and strict mode it is. The ERA is validated for range in all three modes. If only the YEAR_OF_ERA is present, and the mode is smart or lenient, then the last available era is assumed. In strict mode, no era is assumed and the YEAR_OF_ERA is left untouched. If only the ERA is present, then it is left untouched. YEAR, MONTH_OF_YEAR and DAY_OF_MONTH - If all three are present, then they are combined to form a date. In all three modes, the YEAR is validated. If the mode is smart or strict, then the month and day are validated. If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first day of the first month in the requested year, then adding the difference in months, then the difference in days. If the mode is smart, and the day-of-month is greater than the maximum for the year-month, then the day-of-month is adjusted to the last day-of-month. If the mode is strict, then the three fields must form a valid date. YEAR and DAY_OF_YEAR - If both are present, then they are combined to form a date. In all three modes, the YEAR is validated. If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first day of the requested year, then adding the difference in days. If the mode is smart or strict, then the two fields must form a valid date. YEAR, MONTH_OF_YEAR, ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH and ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH - If all four are present, then they are combined to form a date. In all three modes, the YEAR is validated. If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first day of the first month in the requested year, then adding the difference in months, then the difference in weeks, then in days. If the mode is smart or strict, then the all four fields are validated to their outer ranges. The date is then combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first day of the requested year and month, then adding the amount in weeks and days to reach their values. If the mode is strict, the date is additionally validated to check that the day and week adjustment did not change the month. YEAR, MONTH_OF_YEAR, ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH and DAY_OF_WEEK - If all four are present, then they are combined to form a date. The approach is the same as described above for years, months and weeks in ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH. The day-of-week is adjusted as the next or same matching day-of-week once the years, months and weeks have been handled. YEAR, ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR and ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR - If all three are present, then they are combined to form a date. In all three modes, the YEAR is validated. If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first day of the requested year, then adding the difference in weeks, then in days. If the mode is smart or strict, then the all three fields are validated to their outer ranges. The date is then combined in a manner equivalent to creating a date on the first day of the requested year, then adding the amount in weeks and days to reach their values. If the mode is strict, the date is additionally validated to check that the day and week adjustment did not change the year. YEAR, ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR and DAY_OF_WEEK - If all three are present, then they are combined to form a date. The approach is the same as described above for years and weeks in ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR. The day-of-week is adjusted as the next or same matching day-of-week once the years and weeks have been handled. The default implementation is suitable for most calendar systems. If ChronoField.YEAR_OF_ERA is found without an ChronoField.ERA then the last era in Chronology.eras() is used. The implementation assumes a 7 day week, that the first day-of-month has the value 1, that first day-of-year has the value 1, and that the first of the month and year always exists.",
