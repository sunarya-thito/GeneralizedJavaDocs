      "comment": "The field that represents the day-of-quarter. This field allows the day-of-quarter value to be queried and set. The day-of-quarter has values from 1 to 90 in Q1 of a standard year, from 1 to 91 in Q1 of a leap year, from 1 to 91 in Q2 and from 1 to 92 in Q3 and Q4. The day-of-quarter can only be calculated if the day-of-year, month-of-year and year are available. When setting this field, the value is allowed to be partially lenient, taking any value from 1 to 92. If the quarter has less than 92 days, then day 92, and potentially day 91, is in the following quarter. In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a year, quarter-of-year and day-of-quarter. In strict mode, all three fields are validated against their range of valid values. The day-of-quarter field is validated from 1 to 90, 91 or 92 depending on the year and quarter. In smart mode, all three fields are validated against their range of valid values. The day-of-quarter field is validated between 1 and 92, ignoring the actual range based on the year and quarter. If the day-of-quarter exceeds the actual range by one day, then the resulting date is one day later. If the day-of-quarter exceeds the actual range by two days, then the resulting date is two days later. In lenient mode, only the year is validated against the range of valid values. The resulting date is calculated equivalent to the following three stage approach. First, create a date on the first of January in the requested year. Then take the quarter-of-year, subtract one, and add the amount in quarters to the date. Finally, take the day-of-quarter, subtract one, and add the amount in days to the date.
