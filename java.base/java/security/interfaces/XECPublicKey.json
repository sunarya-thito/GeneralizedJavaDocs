  "comment": "An interface for an elliptic curve public key as defined by RFC 7748. These keys are distinct from the keys represented by \n\u003ccode\u003eECPublicKey\u003c/code\u003e, and they are intended for use with algorithms based on RFC 7748 such as the XDH \n\u003ccode\u003eKeyAgreement\u003c/code\u003e algorithm. An XEC public key is a particular point on the curve, which is represented using only its u-coordinate as described in RFC 7748. A u-coordinate is an element of the field of integers modulo some value that is determined by the algorithm parameters. This field element is represented by a BigInteger which may hold any value. That is, the BigInteger is not restricted to the range of canonical field elements.",
