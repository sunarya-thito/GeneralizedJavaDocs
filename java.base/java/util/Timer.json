Timer tasks should complete quickly. If a timer task takes excessive time to complete, it \"hogs\" the timer\u0027s task execution thread. This can, in turn, delay the execution of subsequent tasks, which may \"bunch up\" and execute in rapid succession when (and if) the offending task finally completes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the last live reference to a \u003ccode\u003eTimer\u003c/code\u003e object goes away \u003ci\u003eand\u003c/i\u003e all outstanding tasks have completed execution, the timer\u0027s task execution thread terminates gracefully (and becomes subject to garbage collection). However, this can take arbitrarily long to occur. By default, the task execution thread does not run as a \u003ci\u003edaemon thread\u003c/i\u003e, so it is capable of keeping an application from terminating. If a caller wants to terminate a timer\u0027s task execution thread rapidly, the caller should invoke the timer\u0027s \u003ccode\u003ecancel\u003c/code\u003e method. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the timer\u0027s task execution thread terminates unexpectedly, for example, because its \u003ccode\u003estop\u003c/code\u003e method is invoked, any further attempt to schedule a task on the timer will result in an \u003ccode\u003eIllegalStateException\u003c/code\u003e, as if the timer\u0027s \u003ccode\u003ecancel\u003c/code\u003e method had been invoked. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis class is thread-safe: multiple threads can share a single \u003ccode\u003eTimer\u003c/code\u003e object without the need for external synchronization. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis class does \u003ci\u003enot\u003c/i\u003e offer real-time guarantees: it schedules tasks using the \u003ccode\u003eObject.wait(long)\u003c/code\u003e method. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJava 5.0 introduced the \u003ccode\u003ejava.util.concurrent\u003c/code\u003e package and one of the concurrency utilities therein is the \u003ca href\u003d\"concurrent/ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html\" title\u003d\"class in java.util.concurrent\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eScheduledThreadPoolExecutor\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e which is a thread pool for repeatedly executing tasks at a given rate or delay.
