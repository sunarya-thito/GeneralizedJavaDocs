The READ and WRITE options determines if the file should be opened for reading and/or writing. If neither option is contained in the array then an existing file is opened for reading. In addition to READ and WRITE, the following options may be present: additional options Option Description TRUNCATE_EXISTING When opening an existing file, the file is first truncated to a size of 0 bytes. This option is ignored when the file is opened only for reading. CREATE_NEW If this option is present then a new file is created, failing if the file already exists. When creating a file the check for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This option is ignored when the file is opened only for reading. CREATE If this option is present then an existing file is opened if it exists, otherwise a new file is created. When creating a file the check for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if it does not exist is atomic with respect to other file system operations. This option is ignored if the CREATE_NEW option is also present or the file is opened only for reading. DELETE_ON_CLOSE When this option is present then the implementation makes a best effort attempt to delete the file when closed by the close method. If the close method is not invoked then a best effort attempt is made to delete the file when the Java virtual machine terminates. SPARSE When creating a new file this option is a hint that the new file will be sparse. This option is ignored when not creating a new file. SYNC Requires that every update to the file\u0027s content or metadata be written synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see Synchronized I/O file integrity). DSYNC Requires that every update to the file\u0027s content be written synchronously to the underlying storage device. (see Synchronized I/O file integrity). An implementation may also support additional options. The executor parameter is the ExecutorService to which tasks are submitted to handle I/O events and dispatch completion results for operations initiated on resulting channel. The nature of these tasks is highly implementation specific and so care should be taken when configuring the Executor. Minimally it should support an unbounded work queue and should not run tasks on the caller thread of the execute method. Shutting down the executor service while the channel is open results in unspecified behavior. The attrs parameter is an optional array of file file-attributes to set atomically when creating the file. The new channel is created by invoking the newFileChannel method on the provider that created the Path.",

The handler parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the lock is acquired (or the operation fails). The result passed to the completion handler is the resulting FileLock. The region specified by the position and size parameters need not be contained within, or even overlap, the actual underlying file. Lock regions are fixed in size; if a locked region initially contains the end of the file and the file grows beyond the region then the new portion of the file will not be covered by the lock. If a file is expected to grow in size and a lock on the entire file is required then a region starting at zero, and no smaller than the expected maximum size of the file, should be locked. The two-argument lock(Object,CompletionHandler) method simply locks a region of size Long.MAX_VALUE. If a lock that overlaps the requested region is already held by this Java virtual machine, or this method has been invoked to lock an overlapping region and that operation has not completed, then this method throws OverlappingFileLockException. Some operating systems do not support a mechanism to acquire a file lock in an asynchronous manner. Consequently an implementation may acquire the file lock in a background thread or from a task executed by a thread in the associated thread pool. If there are many lock operations outstanding then it may consume threads in the Java virtual machine for indefinite periods. Some operating systems do not support shared locks, in which case a request for a shared lock is automatically converted into a request for an exclusive lock. Whether the newly-acquired lock is shared or exclusive may be tested by invoking the resulting lock object\u0027s isShared method. File locks are held on behalf of the entire Java virtual machine. They are not suitable for controlling access to a file by multiple threads within the same virtual machine.",
