      "comment": "Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer. This method initiates an asynchronous read operation to read a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer. The handler parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the read operation completes (or fails). The result passed to the completion handler is the number of bytes read or -1 if no bytes could be read because the channel has reached end-of-stream. The read operation may read up to r bytes from the channel, where r is the number of bytes remaining in the buffer, that is, dst.remaining() at the time that the read is attempted. Where r is 0, the read operation completes immediately with a result of 0 without initiating an I/O operation. Suppose that a byte sequence of length n is read, where 0 \u003c n \u003c\u003d r. This byte sequence will be transferred into the buffer so that the first byte in the sequence is at index p and the last byte is at index p + n - 1, where p is the buffer\u0027s position at the moment the read is performed. Upon completion the buffer\u0027s position will be equal to p + n; its limit will not have changed. Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads so care should be taken to not access the buffer until the operation has completed. This method may be invoked at any time. Some channel types may not allow more than one read to be outstanding at any given time. If a thread initiates a read operation before a previous read operation has completed then a ReadPendingException will be thrown.",
