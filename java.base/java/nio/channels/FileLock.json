A shared lock prevents other concurrently-running programs from acquiring an overlapping exclusive lock, but does allow them to acquire overlapping shared locks.

Thus the locks held on a file should be visible to all programs that have access to the file, regardless of the language in which those programs are written. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Whether or not a lock actually prevents another program from accessing the content of the locked region is system-dependent and therefore unspecified. The native file-locking facilities of some systems are merely \u003ci\u003eadvisory\u003c/i\u003e, meaning that programs must cooperatively observe a known locking protocol in order to guarantee data integrity. On other systems native file locks are \u003ci\u003emandatory\u003c/i\u003e, meaning that if one program locks a region of a file then other programs are actually prevented from accessing that region in a way that would violate the lock. On yet other systems, whether native file locks are advisory or mandatory is configurable on a per-file basis. To ensure consistent and correct behavior across platforms, it is strongly recommended that the locks provided by this API be used as if they were advisory locks. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e On some systems, acquiring a mandatory lock on a region of a file prevents that region from being \u003ca href\u003d\"FileChannel.html#map(java.nio.channels.FileChannel.MapMode,long,long)\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003ci\u003emapped into memory\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and vice versa. Programs that combine locking and mapping should be prepared for this combination to fail. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e On some systems, closing a channel releases all locks held by the Java virtual machine on the underlying file regardless of whether the locks were acquired via that channel or via another channel open on the same file. It is strongly recommended that, within a program, a unique channel be used to acquire all locks on any given file. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Some network filesystems permit file locking to be used with memory-mapped files only when the locked regions are page-aligned and a whole multiple of the underlying hardware\u0027s page size. Some network filesystems do not implement file locks on regions that extend past a certain position, often 2\u003csup\u003e30\u003c/sup\u003e or 2\u003csup\u003e31\u003c/sup\u003e. In general, great care should be taken when locking files that reside on network filesystems.\u003c/p\u003e",
