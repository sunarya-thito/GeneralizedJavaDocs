Debugger threads take precautions to prevent these events, but they cannot be avoided under some conditions, especially for some subclasses of Error. If the event was generated by a debugger system thread, the value returned by this method is null, and if the requested suspend policy for the event was EventRequest.SUSPEND_EVENT_THREAD, all threads will be suspended instead, and the EventSet.suspendPolicy() will reflect this change. Note that the discussion above does not apply to system threads created by the target VM during its normal (non-debug) operation.",
